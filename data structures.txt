What is an algorithm.
Algorithms and data structures are the most common interview questions.
you need a fundamental understanding of data structures.

What is an algorithm?
A set of instructions used to solve a problem.
problem being a task that needs a set of instructions to achieve.

The linear search algorithm is defined as a seuential search algorithm
that starts from one end and goes through each element of the list until
the desired element is found; otherwise the search continues until it reaches
the end of a data set.

The binary search algorithm targets a SORTED array. It works by repeatedly
dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or
the interval is empty. THE SEARCH INTERVAL IS HALVED BY COMPARING THE TARGET
TO THE MIDDLE IN THE SEARCH SPACE.

Big O notation
The complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size.
the 'O' in O(n) is the order of magnitude of complexity
the (n) is a function of the size, size of the input.
O(n) describes how an algorithm performs in the worst case scenario, the upper bound.

Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), linear time
Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), logarithmic runtime.
where the logarithm is the inverse of an exponent meaning it is describing
how many times n should occur to evaluate to the result
quadratic runtime O(n^2)
cubic runtime O(n^3)
quasilinear runtime O(n log n), for every value of n run a log n number of
operations (merge sort)
polynomial runtime are O(n^k), usually considered efficient and used often.
constant time is O(1), reading a value in a list for example
exponential runtime O(x^n), least efficient.
